This project aims for Teknofest underwater systems 2022 competition.
I optimized code for detecting circules underwater.<br/>
I used opencv functions in order to run detector, unlike other teams we didn't take advantage of Neural networks because of hardware limitations. Jetson nano has a graphic card which makes it more capable when it comes to running complex networks. But this capabilty come with drawbacks such as high energy need and cooling needs. Whereas raspberry pi4 will consume significantly less energy.
